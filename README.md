This fork replaces the integrated sftp with a forced
[rrsync](https://www.guyrutenberg.com/2014/01/14/restricting-ssh-access-to-rsync/)
command. Please consult atmoz' original readme for more information
about how to use this image!

Currently Alpine-only.

Thank you atmoz for a great image and a great readme!
